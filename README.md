##  Research Motivation & Overview

The economic consequences of political uncertainty have long been a focal point in political economy and financial economics. While classical models like the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) suggest that prices fully reflect public information, newer theories highlight heterogeneity in investor behavior, attention allocation, and narrative amplification.

This project investigates whether media discourse and market behavior demonstrate synchronized sentiment cycles during episodes of heightened uncertainty, particularly in relation to tariff policy shocks.

We hypothesize that emotionally charged, policy-specific media narratives—such as coverage of tariff escalations—not only reflect macroeconomic expectations but actively shape them. Specifically, we ask:  
**Do tariff-related sentiment signals trigger more directional market responses than general financial sentiment?**

To address this, we design a comparative framework that isolates the causal influence of topic-specific sentiment by curating two parallel datasets:

- **Treatment group**: Wall Street Journal articles filtered for “tariff”, “trade war”, “import/export”, and related terms.
- **Control group**: General financial news articles from Bloomberg over the same time frame.

By controlling for time window and model architecture, and varying only the thematic scope of media input, we assess whether markets are more reactive to targeted uncertainty narratives than to ambient sentiment.
